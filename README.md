# expanding-gallery
This repository contains a simple web application showcasing an expanding image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery features interactive panels that expand when clicked, revealing their titles.

## Description

This project implements a dynamic image gallery where each image is presented as a panel. When a panel is clicked, it expands to fill more screen space, while the other panels shrink. This provides an engaging visual experience for browsing images. The gallery utilizes CSS transitions for smooth animations and JavaScript for handling the interactivity.

### Features
*   Interactive expanding panels
*   CSS transitions for smooth animations
*   Responsive layout for mobile and desktop views
*   Simple and clean design

### Files

*   `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the image gallery panels.
*   `style.css`: Styles the panels and their appearance, including transitions.
*   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling panel clicks and activating the expansion effect.

### Usage

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2.  Click on any image panel to expand it.
3.  The clicked panel will expand while other panels will shrink.

### Key Concepts

*   DOM manipulation using `querySelectorAll` and event listeners.
*   CSS flexbox for layout.
*   CSS transitions for smooth animations.
*   Dynamic class manipulation using `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()`.
